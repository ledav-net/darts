 DARTS v1.2.0

 This a dashboard designed for darts players.  Very useful to show your
 actual points while keeping trace of your previous shots.  Depending on the
 mode chosen (pro or beginner) it shows you also the best finish when
 needed.

 Designed to run in console (ncurses) with dimensions of at least 130x50. 
 Numbers are shown in squares of 10x12 so that it can be seen by players
 while playing.

 Have fun !  :-)
